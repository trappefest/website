          One of you, the one you call Thomas but that I shall refer to as ‘The witness’, has unwillingly become a part of it. He has seen the whole event and can therefore help you solve the various clues that have been left behind, but the evil
          force
          is stopping him from acting directly…
          You have the clues for the <strong class="dark">n</strong>ext step right here.”
